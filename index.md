# Sup, I'm Zaptor
I'm just some crazy individual with access to the internet somehow; don't expect too much from me. I've got myself a [GitHub account](https://github.com/ZaptorZap), which I guess should go without saying; look at the darn URL you're on, a [YouTube zone](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRLu8x5T594NtG09DmCFD-w), a [Twitch thingie](https://www.twitch.tv/zaptorzap), one of [those Steam profiles](https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZaptorZap), a Discord user(ZaptorZap#0405) alongside a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vMkm8QHbUY); and a good ol E-Mail address(zaptorzap at gmail dot com).
# Ever heard of that Tetris thing?
Chances are, you're here thanks to my Tetris claim to fame (still need to work on making youtube videos procrastination grr) as opposed to some Gmod series. I got my start with Puyo Puyo Tetris for the Nintendo Switch back in 2018 and I've rode the official releases all the way down to getting Xbox Game Pass for Tetris Effect: Connected (I own the original game for my PS4, and have since the Christmas of 2019)

Clones, however, would be where I spent most of my Tetris playtime. It started with a small Java client known as [NullpoMino](https://github.com/nullpomino/nullpomino), where I would spend my time stacking it out in a 200 line marathon mode all single player. NullpoMino *had* multiplayer compatibility, but I just wasn't interested in getting my organs harvested by the only pros still on this client with no chance of fighting back. While sticking to my solo roots, I'd still watch big players such as [Wumbotize](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVx7kmzyY3z5T_jAgbDW-Fw) since they're one hell of a bug to exterminate from your YouTube recommendations. It was thanks to this guy I found out about [TETR.IO](https://tetr.io) during its "INFDEV" period, and I found myself very interested in it. One thing lead to another and before you knew it I had [an account](https://ch.tetr.io/u/zaptor) I would keep up with from then til now. I would also learn about the [Tetra Legends](https://tetralegends.app/) game; which rewarded All Spins, as opposed to only T-Spins. The game appealed to me since it was a solo only thing with a pretty darn good selection of modes to choose from. I'd also learn of the existence of [Spirit Drop](https://rayblastgames.com/spiritdrop.php) from the [Hard Drop Discord community](https://discord.gg/harddrop) which was also allspin by default(though to be honest, the detection is a bit restricting for me). It's because of this I call myself an allspin player.
